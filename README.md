# Old-English-Translator-App
app made with VanillaJS and used FunTranslation API


I had made a translator web app using VanillaJS, and hosted it using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/), also used free API of [Funtranslation](https://funtranslations.com/).
So, do visit and explore the english which was at the time of shakespeare and how it vary from modern english through this web app.
